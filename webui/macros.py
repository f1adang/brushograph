"""Five small utility routines.

home.g parks the brush, paper.g positions it over the paper for a placement
check, and clean.g washes the brush the way a real job does before parking
too. The wash in clean.g follows whichever container shape
`brushograph.cup_shape` names, classic or modern. All three, plus zero.g's
own last line, end the same way — parked at X0 Y0, Z = Dip Depth + 1 — via
the shared `_park_at_origin()`.

zero.g is the machine's own self-zero dance — a fixed sequence tuned on the
actual hardware, reproduced here verbatim, with the config read for nothing
but that final park.

calibrate.g is the odd one out on purpose: no wash, no lift first, just the
dot and a park over it, at two literal heights that are neither
`canvas_height` nor `go_in_tray_lift`.

None of the five carries an M-code or a G28, so none needs the controller
dialect handling `gcode_pipeline.sanitize_for_controller` does for a real job:
G90/G0/G1/G10 are understood the same way by Marlin, GRBL and FluidNC.
